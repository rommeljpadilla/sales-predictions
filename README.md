# sales-predictions

The purpose of this project is to predict and give an informed decision given the data. Data given includes the following:

 -   Item_Identifier            
 -   Item_Weight                
 -   Item_Fat_Content           
 -   Item_Visibility           
 -   Item_Type                   
 -   Item_MRP                   
 -   Outlet_Identifier          
 -   Outlet_Establishment_Year  
 -   Outlet_Size                
 -   Outlet_Location_Type        
 -   Outlet_Type                
 -  Item_Outlet_Sales          


Given the data, we wanted to see if outlet size and establishment year affect the sales of the outlet.

If a company wants to expand, does the timing of the establishment matter? Is it too late to establish a new outlet?

Based on the line graph and scatterplot, we can see that there is no trend based on establishment year and sales. 1985 and 1998 appears to be outliers. It is troublesome that it appears to be on a small downswing, but I do not see a strong correlation between establishment year and item sales.


If a company wants to expand and look at locations to purchase, does the size of a location affect item sales?

Based on the bar graph, we can see that medium sized outlets perform better than bigger sized and smaller sized locations. When looking to expand and look for new locations,
it is important to value sq/ft but the data shows that costs might be worth it for a medium sized location. It also shows that we can save costs by not being tempted to buy a
bigger sized location. In this case, bigger is not better. It is important to find the sweet spot.
